Five Graphs in Scatt Software:


1-Coordination Diagram:

The result is demonstrated by the 'Coordination Diagram' in which the time (taken second as a unit) is represented on the X-axis, deflection (Teiler) from the centre of the target along the Y-axis.

2-Centre distance Graph: 

This analysis is represented by two graphs. The first graph depicts the distance from the aiming trajectory’s points to the target’s centre, both vertically and horizontally.
The second graph shows absolute deflection of the trajectory’s points from the centre of the target. Both graphs provide the information about the same shot.


3-Shift of Shooting Moment Graph:

This graph not only shows the result of the shooting at the moment of firing, but also it can be compared with the possible result, if firing had occurred a fraction of a second earlier.

4-Shoot Interval Graph:

This diagram illustrates the best timing points of the each shot and time intervals between them. Based on this data, a shooter can select his/her optimum shooting pace.

5-Aiming trajectory Graph:

This graph represents the speed of the trajectory’s movement on the target, effectively measuring a shooter’s steadiness. It is a very useful graph for analysis of the steadiness and of shooting between heartbeats.

Basic Features of Scatt Software:

1-Printing:

The system simulates the path of aim for the distance of target up to 1000 meters. You can stand at 5 meter to do 50 meter shooting using reduced scale targets. Software has feature of printing reduced scale targets.

2-Aiming Trace:

This measures the weapon’s movement relative to the target, both before and after shooting. Accurate measurement of the trajectory provides precise information about aim and point of impact.
The trajectory sections are highlighted in different colors (default settings: aim before shooting – green, one second before shooting – yellow, after shooting – red). You can easily change the colors of the trajectory sections, as well as add supplementary colors.

Zooming onto the target, with the help of the mouse or keyboard, will let you closely scrutinize the section of the trajectory you are interested in.

The program automatically repeats the aiming trajectory right after the shot is fired, as whilst aiming, the shooter is unable to watch the computer display.
